I am a Machine Learning Researcher

Currently, I am a reseach intern at [Pacmed](https://pacmed.ai/en) working on causal inference. 

Before, I studied logic at the Institute for Logic Language and Computations at UvA in Amsterdam and I hold a master's degree in mathematics obtained at University of Warsaw. 

For my full CV check ... 

Applying insights from mathematical understanding of machine learning methodology to real-world data is the thing that I find the most rewarding.
